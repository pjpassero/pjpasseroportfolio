                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I always get asked how I learned to code. Before my Junior year of high school, I had no formal introduction to programming besides basic elementary school lessons that used block code, like Code.org. To date, everything I know about web development I have learned on my own time. Other languages like Python, C, C#, C++, have grabbed my attention as well. I have put some time into learning them, but they don’t grab my attention the way web development languages do. I do have to say I use Python for data analysis for fun. 2020 accelerated what I could learn because of the time I had. School wasn’t a thing in the Spring of 2020 because there was no working distance learning plan in place yet. So, I used this time to learn a little bit of PHP. It was one of the best things I did because learning PHP opened so many doors to what I could now do. PHP allowed me to build systems I always wanted to build but never could such as login and registration systems. One thing I wish I did was to learn Laravel sooner. Laravel, if you don’t know, is an open-source PHP framework. In my opinion, it takes a lot of the confusion out of PHP. I like the way I can construct MySQL queries with Laravel. It not only looks better, it feels safer as well.

                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; So why does this matter? Many people asked me what I used when learning to code. This is a hard question to answer because it is hard to explain to people that practice is what is important. Initially, when I started, I wanted to buy books online for HTML, Javascript, etc to learn to code. Looking back, I am really glad I didn’t do this. In my opinion, this would have been a waste of money because I have the greatest tool ever made available to me, The Internet. Plus, things in the programming world change fast, so before I know it, that HTML book would be outdated. To be clear, I am not saying you should disregard programming books as a whole. Using the Internet at first is perfectly fine and it will allow you to see if programming is for you without spending money. So instead, I jumped right in and began building things and playing with code. So what happened when I ran into a problem? Technically I didn’t know what I was doing. When I come across a problem, Stack Overflow is my first go-to. As you dive deeper into programming you realize that there is a high chance that someone has run into the same problem you currently face and a simple Google search of that problem will bring you right to Stack Overflow. Even if Stack Overflow doesn’t have the answer, the language’s documentation or another lesser-known web forum will most likely have it. The posts on Stack Overflow that are the best are the ones that give you a detailed solution on solving your problem and where you went wrong. This is so useful when starting.

                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Youtube is another great tool to use when learning to code. FreeCodeCamp has a truly amazing channel. If you are looking to learn to code, I would go and check them out! They have tutorials on pretty much any language you want to learn and they are detailed. You can follow along with the videos easily and learn quickly. The best part is is that the long videos are broken up into chunks so you don’t have to watch the video all at once. Another tool I used was SoloLearn which was good for learning the basics and the syntaxes of a language. There are other methods out there like paid courses and boot camps, which are good, but if you aren’t serious about coding yet, Youtube and SoloLearn will work. Now all these tools are great in all, but they are useless. Yes, they are useless because understanding and being able to replicate what these programs and videos teach is on you.

                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; You have to take the time to write your code. This will be the key to your success as a programmer. You have to be creative with what you do. In my Sophomore year of high school, I took Collegeboard’s AP Computer Science Principles course. We worked on apps in MIT App Inventor which was a super cool tool, but it was block coding. It was fun to do, but I was way past this level in coding. This class was loaded with tons of other interesting concepts. One concept was learning about algorithms that calculate the shortest path between a given set of points. We learned why this is a limitation to some algorithms because it is impossible to solve a problem like this. One problem we learned about was the Traveling Salesman problem. How can the salesman visit every town on the map and return to the starting city by taking the shortest route? This got me thinking and I wanted some way to visualize this. So I opened Visual Studio code, created a new folder with an HTML, Javascript, and CSS file, and began coding. What I wound up doing was initializing an HTML canvas. When the page loaded, a Javascript function generated a random set of points on the canvas. I then designed a function to calculate the distance to the next closest point and then drew a line. This would continue until I reached the endpoint. In the end, the distance traveled was returned. Although this doesn’t exactly match the description of The Travelling Salesmen problem, I am still proud of what I was able to do. This taught me to apply my web development skillset as well as math concepts such as the distance formula. I also was able to incorporate object-oriented programming in the code which was still new to me at this point. I eventually rewrote and refactored this program using Jquery because the original code I wrote was atrocious. Like it was really bad, I cannot believe I wrote it.

                    <p>
                        &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; So what does all this say? You have to practice to be good at programming. You have to persevere and be open to failure to be able to write code. Practicing applies to all areas of life to any skill you want to learn. Practicing writing code involves creativity as well. One thing I do daily is look at problems and see if I can write a solution to them in code. This may sound dumb, but writing even a simple program to a problem with a simple solution will help keep your skills sharp. I also urge people to see how they can apply code to be unique and creative when it comes to things like school. I have made many sites for school projects that were unique and also met the criteria for the class. I’m not talking about building a Google site for a history report, I’m talking about building something like a fully custom interactive poster. This is one I built for class in my Freshman year of high school. Practicing your skills is important. I can now say I am confident in presenting my work. It doesn’t matter if you don’t build the next Facebook or Google, it matters that you understand what you are doing. If you can do that you will be successful in programming.
